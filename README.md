# 1. Project Title
Heart Attack Predictor App via Streamlit

# 2. Project Description
This dataset has 303 observations with 13 features which target whether a patient is getting heart attack or vice versa on their current medical condition.

# 3. Data Description
Train Set

Contains the ![data](https://github.com/GeoLai/As_2-HeartAttackPredictionApp/tree/main/dataset) to be used for model building and model testing. It can be segregated into training set and testing set. It has the true labels for whether the patient has heart or not (1) or not (0)

This data was tested with another 10 observations of external dataset which has success rate of 80% prediction against the true observations
